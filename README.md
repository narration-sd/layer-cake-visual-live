This is a sample of what you will get by combining two projects from Simeon Griggs in Sanity's learning site: 

- **_Content-driven web application foundations_**, and then
- **_Integrated Visual Editing with Next.js_**

Notes:

- the alt text on mainImage has been set to a proper value, so that click-to-edit will work on the image
- size of the mainImage has been altered for the web page, request and render, for better layout on medium width page, but to do this right needs some grid etc. layout.
